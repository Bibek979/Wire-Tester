# Wire-Tester
I was testing my wires to use on a IOT Project and the Multimeter just showed battery low and as there was no battery around. Made this little project 

##Made for NODEMCU 1.0

#HOW TO USE AFTER UPLOADING

1. Take one end of the wire and insert to 3v3 pin.
2. And the other one to D8 Pin 
3. Open the serial Monitor and it should be showing realtime.
